(https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)

1. Remove the `dist` directory from the projectâ€™s `.gitignore` file.

2. Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).

    ```sh
    git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
    ```
3. Use subtree push to send it to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub. (see 'package.json' for script)
